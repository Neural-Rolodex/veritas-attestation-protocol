## 🌟 Overview

**veritas-attestation-protocol** provides production-grade infrastructure for the Stellar network, focusing on high availability, formal invariant guarantees, and seamless developer integration. It delivers atomic state transitions, telemetry streaming, and automated execution rails tailored for high-volume ecosystem applications.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & Features

- **Decentralized Execution**: Fully autonomous smart contracts and backend services integrated with Stellar Horizon and Soroban RPC.
- **Invariant Guarantees**: Core state machines verified with property-based testing and fuzzing harnesses.
- **High-Throughput Settlement**: Optimized transaction batching, event streaming, and sub-second reconciliation.
- **Granular Access Control**: Multi-sig authorization schemes, caller cooldown mechanics, and bounded storage partitions.
- **Enterprise Telemetry**: Distributed tracing, Prometheus metrics, and structured log emissions for full operational visibility.
